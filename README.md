# Custom Converse-JS headless build

To install this build, use the following command:

`npm i https://github.com/binuadmin/moya-conversejs-ios`


Note:

This is just a pre-built (and minified) library. Any future changes should ideally be done after the source code is added here with scripts to build from that.
